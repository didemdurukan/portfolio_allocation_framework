# UniFi: A Unified Framework for Portfolio Management
"UniFi" is a portfolio management framework that consists of several machine learning and deep reinforcement learning models accompanied by data collection, preparation and backtesting utilities. 
The uniFi framework also provides enough flexibility for users to implement their own mechanism and integrate it into the system.

The proposed framework is structured in three sequential layers: Financial Data Layer, Agent Layer, and the Evaluation Layer. 

All of the classes mentioned below belongs the their own .py files with the same name of the classes.

## FinancialDataLayer
Financial Data Layer contains two main sections namely DataCollection and DataProcessing.

DataCollection section has DatasetCollector abstract base class. DataDownloader and CustomDatasetImporter classes inherits the DatasetCollector class.
## AgentLayer
Agent Layer contains ConventionalAgents, RLAgents, Environment, DataSplitter, metrics and TestDir sections. Besides them, it contains an Agent abstract base class.

ConventinalAgents section contains ConventionalAgent abstract base class which inherits Agent class. DTAgent (Decision Tree Agent), HRAgent (Huber Regression Agent), LRAgent (Linear Regression Agent), RFAgent (Random Forest Agent) and SVRAgent (Support Vector Regression Agent) classes inherits the ConventionalAgent class.

RLAgents section contains RLAgent abstract base class which inherits Agent class. A2C (A2C Agent), DDPG (DDPG Agent), PPO (PPO Agent) and TD3 (TD3 Agent) classes inherits RLAgent class.

Environment section contaions Environment abstract base class. PortfolioEnv (Portfolio Environment) inherits the Environment class.

DataSpliiter section contains BlockingTimeSeriesSplitter class and TimeSeriesSplitter class.

Metrics section contains a regression.py file which implements several error metrics as methods.

Testdir section contains tests of functionalities of all agents and splitting methods. A2C_test.py, DDPG_test.py, DT_test.py, HR_test.py, LR_test.py, PPO_test.py, RF_test.py, SVR_test.py, TD3_test.py and Splitter_test.py files are included in this section. 

## EvaluationLayer
Evaluation  Layer contains Evaluator abstract base class. ExtendedPortfolioEvaluator and PorftolioEvaluator classes inherits Evaluator class. SharpeStats.py file implements distinct sharpe ratio calculation methods.
